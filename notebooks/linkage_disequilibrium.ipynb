        "-   More complicated pure-simulation methods approach the problem by taking a population and a given evolutionary model and following them forwards or backwards in time\n",
        "-   For example, they may start with a population with very little LD (most variants are independent) and force it through population bottlenecks to create LD blocks\n",
        "-   Alternatively, they may start with very strong LD blocks (most variants dependent) and making the population undergo mating/recombination to break up the LD blocks till LD structure reaches the desired level\n",
        "-   These methods are typically more complicated to implement than what we've done here - they may represent both chromosomes to allow for crossing-over during meiosis, for example\n",
        "-   A classic example is [GenomeSIMLA](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-78757-0_3), but there are [a huge number of options these day](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/gepi.21876)\n",
        "-   Realistically though, these methods can all be computationally intensive, and aren't used that often\n",
        "-   Usually, when we're not too bothered about closely mimicking a real population, it's easier to simulate yourself, as we do here, so you can precisely control the aspects you want that may not be available in a given package\n",
        "-   When we want more realistic LD structure, it's far easier (and probably more realistic) to just take it from real data\n",

        " - We can then fit ML models to this data, but\n",
        " - LD presents a significant issue for identifying the causal variant in a dataset\n",
        " \n",
        "There are a few logical follow-on questions. First is whether different ML models can perform better in such a scenario. Second is, given PRS often out-perform ML methods on complex trait prediction, is this largely due to how they handle LD?"
